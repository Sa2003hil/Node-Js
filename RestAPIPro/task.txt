Here We are going to make an REST API - (Basically JSON based API)

Important NOTE:
Server is basically a hybrid server , means humara server aisa hona chahiye ki vo
browser ko bhi support kare and another mobile apps ko bhi support kare.

'/users' --> returning JSON

means any user do GET req on 

'/users' ---> render HTML document
'/api/users' ---> return JSON (mobile apps)

Basically we are making an Hybrid server which can support both browser and mobile apps.This is a good practice to do.

GET /users - List all users ✅
GET /api/users - List all users ✅
GET /api/user/1 - GET the user with id 1
GET /api/user/2 - GET the user with id 2


POST /api/users - Create new users

PATCH /api/user/id - Edit the user with id 1..n

DELETE /api/users/id - Delete the user with id 1..n

to do all these things firstly we want a data here we don't have any data
